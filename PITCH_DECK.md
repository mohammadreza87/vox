**What Vox Is:**
- One app that connects to Gemini, Claude, GPT-4, and DeepSeek
- Each AI "contact" has its own voice, personality, and purpose
- Voice cloning lets you hear yourself (or anyone) in any language
- Future: Group chats where multiple AI models collaborate

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Speaker Notes:**

*"Let's be honest. ChatGPT has folders. Claude has projects. The 'chaos' problem is being solved.*

*But here's what ISN'T solved: You can't use Claude for one task and GPT for another in the same app. You can't have different voices for different topics. And you definitely can't have multiple AIs in one conversation.*

*That's the real gap we're filling."*

**Speaker Notes:**

*"These are our three defensible differentiators:*

*One: Multi-model. No other consumer app lets you switch between Gemini, Claude, GPT, and DeepSeek per conversation. We're model-agnostic.*

*Two: Voice-per-contact. This isn't just about memory—it's about context switching. When you hear Alice's voice, your brain shifts to 'interview mode.' When you hear Carlos, you're in 'Spanish mode.'*

*Three: Group AI chat. This doesn't exist anywhere. Imagine asking a question and having Claude, GPT, and Gemini all respond, debate each other, and reach consensus. That's our roadmap."*

**Speaker Notes:**

*"Yes, we're a wrapper. Perplexity is also a wrapper—Google Search plus OpenAI plus a better UI. They're worth $9 billion.*

*The lesson: Wrappers can win if the experience is dramatically better. Our bet is that voice-first, multi-model AI is 10x better than what exists today.*

*We just have to prove it with users."*

**Speaker Notes:**

*"Voice cloning is powerful. And power requires responsibility.*

*The magic: Record 30 seconds of your voice. Now hear yourself speak fluent Spanish. That's transformative for language learning.*

*The risk: Fraud, deepfakes, impersonation. We know this.*

*Our approach: Video verification to prove identity. One personal clone per user. ID verification for additional clones. Abuse detection. Clear legal terms.*

*We're building safety into the product, not bolting it on after an incident."*

**Speaker Notes:**

*"Let's be honest about who we're building for.*

*Primary audience: The voice-native generation. Gen Z sends voice notes instead of texts. Gen Alpha talks to Alexa before they can read. For them, voice-first AI isn't weird—it's natural.*

*Secondary: Power users who need multi-model access and voice cloning for specific use cases.*

*Who we're NOT targeting yet: Enterprise (we need compliance), older demographics (voice fatigue is real), and the privacy-conscious (voice is intimate data).*

*Start narrow. Prove it works. Then expand."*

**Speaker Notes:**

*"I'm not going to show you a $300 billion TAM slide. That's lazy math that insults your intelligence.*

*Here's the honest bottom-up: About 50 million people pay for AI tools globally. Maybe 10% want voice-first. Maybe 20% of those will try a new app. Maybe 5% convert to paid.*

*That's 50,000 paying users at $15/month = $9M ARR potential in year 1-2.*

*Is that a billion-dollar market? No. Is it a real business we can build? Yes. And if we're right about voice-native generations, the market grows with them."*

**Speaker Notes:**

*"Here's where I'm honest with you: We haven't done the full unit economics yet.*

*Voice AI is expensive. ElevenLabs charges per character. LLMs charge per token. Our free tier might be bleeding money.*

*What we need to figure out before scaling: Exact cost per user, whether free tier is sustainable, and what usage limits actually protect margins.*

*This is MVP stage. We built the product. Now we need to build the business."*

**Speaker Notes:**

*"We have three hypotheses that need validation:*

*One: Does voice-per-contact actually help memory and context? This is our core thesis. We need to test it with real users, not assume it.*

*Two: Do users actually care about multi-model? Or do they just use the default? We need analytics to prove this matters.*

*Three: Will people pay for voice AI? The free tier is nice, but we need 5%+ conversion to build a business.*

*These aren't rhetorical questions. These are the experiments we need to run."*

**Speaker Notes:**

*"Let's be real about competition.*

*OpenAI has 200 million users. Google has infinite distribution. We can't beat them on scale.*

*But we can beat them on experience. ChatGPT Voice is good, but it's one voice, one model. We're multi-model, multi-voice, with cloning.*

*Our window is probably 12-18 months before big players add these features. We need to build a loyal user base before that happens."*

*After that: If it works, scale. If it doesn't, pivot or shut down.*

**Speaker Notes:**

*"Why now? Four timing factors:*

*One: Voice AI just got good enough. ElevenLabs quality is nearly indistinguishable from human.*

*Two: The multi-model world is here. Claude is best at reasoning. GPT at coding. Gemini at multimodal. No one model wins everything.*

*Three: The voice-native generation is entering the workforce. Gen Z prefers voice notes to texts.*

*Four: AI costs are dropping, making voice AI economically viable.*

*Two years ago, this was too early. Two years from now, everyone will have copied it. The window is now."*

**Speaker Notes:**

*"What we actually have: A working product built in 4 weeks. Multi-model. Voice cloning. Translation. Payments. It works.*

*What we're honest about: Limited tests. No security audit. No load testing. Voice safety features are designed but not built.*

*This is an MVP. It's live. It works. But it needs hardening before scale."*

**Speaker Notes:**

*"Two options depending on your risk appetite:*

*Option A: $250-500K angel round. 6 months to validate hypotheses, prove retention, and get to 1,000 paying users. If we hit that, we've proven the model.*

*Option B: $1-2M seed. 18 months runway, hire a small team, and get to 10,000 paying users and $1M ARR.*

*Most of the money goes to engineering and AI costs. Voice AI isn't cheap."*

**Speaker Notes:**

*"Let me close honestly.*

*We know the product works. We know the technology is there. We think the timing is right.*

*We don't know yet if users will retain and pay. We don't know if voice-per-contact actually matters. We don't know if the unit economics work.*

*We're not promising to be the next billion-dollar company. We're promising to find out if this is a real business. If it is, we're first. If it isn't, we'll know in 6 months and you'll know too.*

*That's Vox. Thank you."*

## What Needs Work

| Area | Issue | Plan |
|------|-------|------|
| Testing | Low coverage | Add unit + E2E tests |
| Security | No audit | Hire auditor |
| Voice safety | Not built | Implement verification |
| Load testing | None | Test before marketing |
| Unit economics | Unknown | Calculate ASAP |

---

# 🗺️ REALISTIC ROADMAP

## Phase 1: Validate (Now - Month 3)
- [ ] User research: 100 users, test hypotheses
- [ ] Calculate exact unit economics
- [ ] Implement voice cloning safety
- [ ] Add test coverage
- [ ] Security audit

## Phase 2: Prove (Month 4-6)
- [ ] Launch Group AI Chat feature
- [ ] Achieve D7 retention > 25%
- [ ] Achieve free → paid conversion > 5%
- [ ] Optimize API costs (caching, routing)

## Phase 3: Decide (Month 7-12)
- [ ] If metrics work: Raise seed, scale marketing
- [ ] If metrics fail: Pivot focus or wind down
- [ ] Consider B2B ONLY if B2C proven

## What We're NOT Building (Yet)
- ❌ Voice marketplace
- ❌ Celebrity partnerships
- ❌ Enterprise features
- ❌ Smart home integration
- ❌ VR/AR integration

# 🎯 RISK MATRIX

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Voice cloning abuse | High | High | Safety features, verification |
| Unit economics negative | Medium | High | Calculate before scaling |
| Big player copies us | High | Medium | Move fast, build loyalty |
| Users don't retain | Medium | High | Validate before scaling |
| API costs spike | Medium | Medium | Caching, cost optimization |

# 💬 FAQS FOR INVESTORS

**Q: What if OpenAI adds multi-model?**
A: They won't. Their business model is selling their own model. We're model-agnostic by design.

**Q: What's your moat?**
A: Honestly, limited moat right now. Our moat is speed of execution and being first to voice-first multi-model. If we're right, we build brand loyalty before others catch up.

**Q: Why not just use ChatGPT Voice?**
A: One model, one voice, no cloning, no translation, no contact system. We're the unbundling of ChatGPT Voice.

**Q: What if ElevenLabs raises prices?**
A: Risk. We'd need to negotiate volume pricing or find alternatives. This is a real dependency.

**Q: Why should I believe this team?**
A: We built a full product in 4 weeks with payments, voice cloning, multi-model, and translation. We ship fast.
